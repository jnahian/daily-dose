  - Add rate limit reset logic and cooldown period management
  - Write unit tests for rate limiting logic including concurrent access scenarios
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 6.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement Sentry audit logger with structured event logging

  - Create AuditLogger class that sends structured events to Sentry
  - Implement command execution logging with performance metrics
  - Add security event logging with appropriate severity levels
  - Implement custom data scrubbing to protect sensitive information
  - Create Sentry event categories and tagging system

  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Build security monitoring service for threat detection

  - Implement SecurityMonitor class with anomaly detection algorithms
  - Add suspicious activity pattern detection for unusual command usage
  - Implement automatic threat response mechanisms
  - Create Sentry alerts for security violations with appropriate severity
  - Write unit tests for security monitoring including threat simulation
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 8. Create protection middleware that orchestrates all security layers

  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Update existing command handlers to use protection middleware

  - Wrap all team management commands (create, join, leave, list) with protection middleware
  - Apply protection to standup commands (submit, modal handling)
  - Protect leave management commands (set, cancel, list, workdays)
  - Update command registration in src/commands/index.js to use protected handlers
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 10. Implement comprehensive error handling and user guidance system

  - Create standardized error response format for all protection failures
  - Add specific error messages for authentication, authorization, validation, and rate limit errors
  - Implement helpful usage guidance when commands fail validation
