# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive protection mechanisms for Slack commands in the Daily Dose standup application to prevent misuse, unauthorized access, and ensure proper command execution. The protection system will include authentication, authorization, rate limiting, input validation, and audit logging to maintain security and system integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want commands to be protected against unauthorized access, so that only legitimate users can execute sensitive operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes any command THEN the system SHALL verify the user is authenticated with Slack
2. WHEN a user attempts to execute a team management command THEN the system SHALL verify the user has appropriate permissions for that team
3. WHEN a user tries to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL deny access and return an appropriate error message
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL reject the command and provide authentication guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to control who can create and manage teams, so that team structure remains organized and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to create a team THEN the system SHALL verify the user has team creation permissions
2. WHEN a user tries to modify team settings THEN the system SHALL verify the user is a team admin or owner
3. WHEN a user attempts to remove members from a team THEN the system SHALL verify the user has admin privileges for that team
4. IF a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL return a permission denied message with guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to prevent command spam and abuse, so that the system remains responsive and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes commands THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits per user per command type
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL temporarily block the user and provide a cooldown message
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log the activity and optionally alert administrators
4. IF a user is rate limited THEN the system SHALL inform them when they can try again

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all command inputs to be validated and sanitized, so that the system is protected against injection attacks and invalid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command receives input parameters THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs against expected formats
2. WHEN invalid input is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the command and provide specific error messages
3. WHEN processing user-provided text THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
4. IF input validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and return helpful usage information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all command executions to be logged and auditable using Sentry, so that we can track system usage, investigate issues, and monitor application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command is executed THEN the system SHALL log the user, command, parameters, and timestamp to Sentry as structured events
2. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL create detailed audit entries in Sentry with appropriate tags and context
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details to Sentry for debugging while protecting sensitive information using Sentry's data scrubbing features
4. WHEN security events are detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts to Sentry with appropriate severity levels
5. IF Sentry logging fails THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without blocking command execution and optionally fall back to local logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and guidance when commands fail, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
2. WHEN a user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL explain what permissions are needed and how to obtain them
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly messages without exposing technical details
4. IF a command is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide usage examples and parameter descriptions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to detect and prevent malicious command usage patterns, so that the system remains secure against attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unusual command patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for review
2. WHEN potential security threats are identified THEN the system SHALL implement automatic protective measures
3. WHEN commands contain suspicious content THEN the system SHALL block execution and log the attempt
4. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and potentially disable the user account
