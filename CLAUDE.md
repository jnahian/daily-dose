## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **Entry Point**: `src/app.js` - Main application file with Slack Bolt setup and Express server
- **Commands**: `src/commands/` - Slack slash command handlers (team, leave, standup, preferences, holiday)
- **Workflows**: `src/workflows/` - Slack interactive component handlers (buttons, modals, actions)
- **Services**: `src/services/` - Business logic (scheduler, standup, team, user)
- **Utilities**: `src/utils/` - Helper functions (date, message, command, user, logger, permission, team, blockHelper)
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Web Frontend**: React SPA in `web/` directory (served from `web/dist/`)
- **Scripts**: Administrative scripts in `scripts/` directory

### Key Services
- **SchedulerService**: Manages cron jobs for standup reminders and posting
- **StandupService**: Handles standup submission, formatting, and posting logic
- **TeamService**: Team creation, member management, and configuration
- **UserService**: User onboarding and organization membership

### Database Schema
Multi-tenant design with Organizations → Teams → Users hierarchy:
- **Organizations**: One per Slack workspace (slackWorkspaceId unique)
- **Teams**: Multiple per org, linked to Slack channels (slackChannelId unique)
- **Users**: Identified by slackUserId, can join multiple organizations and teams
- **Junction Tables**: OrganizationMember (with OrgRole), TeamMember (with TeamRole)
- **Leave System**: Leave table tracks user absences with date ranges
- **Holiday System**: Holiday table for organization-wide holidays
- **Standup Data**: StandupResponse (submissions), StandupPost (channel posts with thread tracking)

**Key Schema Patterns:**
- All IDs are UUIDs generated by Prisma
- Cascade deletes configured for organizational hierarchy
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (slackUserId, teamId, standupDate)
- TeamMember table has `receiveNotifications` and `hideFromNotResponded` flags for user preferences
- Team table stores times as strings (HH:MM format) with timezone
- Work days stored as JSON array in User table (e.g., [1,2,3,4,5] for Mon-Fri)

### Slack Integration
- Socket mode disabled - uses HTTP endpoints via ExpressReceiver
- Comprehensive slash commands with `/dd-` prefix
- Interactive components (buttons, modals) for standup submission
- Automated posting to team channels with formatting
- Block Kit UI components defined in `src/utils/blockHelper.js`
- All blocks must follow formatting guidelines from `docs/slack-markdown-guidelines.md`

### Web Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript and Vite
- **Routing**: React Router 7 for client-side routing with SPA fallback
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme support
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for transitions and interactive elements
- **Icons**: Lucide React + LordIcon for animated icons
- **Build Output**: Built to `web/dist/` and served by Express static middleware
- **Pages**: Home, Docs, Scripts (auth-protected), Changelog, Contact, Legal (Privacy, Terms)
- **Components**: Organized by feature (home, docs, scripts, changelog, auth)
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode with context provider in `web/src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`

### Environment Configuration
Key environment variables in `.env`:
- **Slack tokens**: BOT_TOKEN, SIGNING_SECRET, APP_TOKEN, USER_TOKEN
- **Database URLs**: DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL
- **App settings**: PORT, DEFAULT_TIMEZONE, APP_URL
- **Logging**: LOG_LEVEL, SENTRY_DSN (optional)
- **Scripts Auth**: SCRIPTS_AUTH_USERNAME, SCRIPTS_AUTH_PASSWORD (for /scripts-docs route protection)

## Development Notes

### Web Frontend Development Workflow

**Development Setup:**
1. Main bot runs on port 3000 (configured via PORT env var)
2. Web dev server runs separately: `cd web && npm run dev` (usually port 5173)
3. In development, test web UI via Vite dev server for hot reload
4. Before deployment, build web app: `cd web && npm run build`
5. Production serves built files from `web/dist/` via Express static middleware

**Key Frontend Conventions:**
- All routes use React Router with SPA fallback in `src/app.js`
- Theme switching via ThemeContext (localStorage persistence)
- Page transitions with Framer Motion via PageTransition component
- Protected routes (like /scripts-docs) should implement BasicAuth component
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints

**Adding New Web Pages:**
1. Create page component in `web/src/pages/`
2. Add route to `web/src/App.tsx`
3. Update Navbar component if needed
4. Build and test: `npm run build && npm start`
5. Verify SPA fallback works for direct URL access

### Middleware System
- Global logging middleware for all Slack interactions
- Command formatting removal middleware to handle Slack's automatic formatting
- Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging

### Scheduling Architecture
Uses node-cron for:
- Daily standup reminders at configured team times
- Automatic standup posting after collection period
- Daily schedule refresh at midnight
- Timezone-aware scheduling per team

### Data Flow
1. Users join organizations automatically via Slack workspace (OrganizationMember created)
2. Teams created in specific channels with configured times (Team + TeamMember records)
3. Scheduler sends DM reminders at standup time (via schedulerService cron jobs)
4. User clicks button → opens modal (action handler in workflows/)
5. Responses collected via modal submission (StandupResponse created/updated)
6. Summary posted to team channel at posting time (StandupPost record tracks thread)
7. Late submissions added as thread replies (using slackMessageTs from StandupPost)

### Common Development Patterns

**Command Parameter Parsing:**
- Use `commandHelper.parseCommandText()` for consistent parsing
- Support both channel-based (no team name) and name-based (explicit team) commands
- Use `teamHelper.resolveTeamFromContext()` for context-aware team resolution

**Permission Checking:**
- Use `permissionHelper.isTeamAdmin()` and `permissionHelper.isOrgOwner()`
- Context-aware commands allow admins in team channel or owners from anywhere
- Always check permissions before executing admin-only operations

**Date Handling:**
- Use dayjs for all date operations with timezone support
- Convert team.timezone for accurate scheduling
- Use `dateHelper.isWorkDay()` to check user's work days
- Check holidays with Holiday table before sending reminders

**Message Formatting:**
- Rich text from modals: use `messageHelper.extractPlainText()` or `messageHelper.convertRichTextToSlack()`
- Always escape user input when constructing messages
- Use blockHelper functions for consistent UI
- Test block rendering in Slack (especially mentions, links, formatting)

**Notification System:**
- `TeamMember.receiveNotifications` controls ALL notifications for a user:
  - Standup reminder DMs (though admins are excluded from reminders by role)
  - Admin notifications about team member submissions (notificationService)
- Use `/dd-standup-reminder notify=on/off` to toggle this setting
- Admin submission notifications sent via `notificationService.notifyAdminsOfStandupSubmission()`
- Admins are automatically filtered out of standup reminders in schedulerService

### Permission System
The application implements a role-based permission system for administrative commands:
- **Organization Owners**: Users who created the organization (have access to all teams)
- **Team Admins**: Members with ADMIN role in TeamMember table (can manage specific teams)
- **Permission Helper** (`src/utils/permissionHelper.js`): Provides functions to check user roles
- **Context-Aware Commands**: Automatically resolve team from channel for admins, require explicit team name for owners

### Manual Standup Trigger Commands (Admin/Owner)
Four new slash commands allow manual control of automated standup operations:
- `/dd-standup-remind [team-name]` - Manually send standup reminders to all active team members
- `/dd-standup-post [date] [team-name]` - Post standup summary for any date (includes late responses)
- `/dd-standup-preview [date] [team-name]` - Preview standup summary as ephemeral message before posting
- `/dd-standup-followup [team-name]` - Send followup reminders to members who haven't responded

**Implementation Details:**
- Commands use context-aware team resolution via `teamHelper.js`
- Admins can run commands in team channel without team name
- Owners must specify team name when running from any location
- Date parsing supports optional YYYY-MM-DD format for historical standups
- All commands integrated with existing `schedulerService` and `standupService` logic

### Block Kit UI Development
When creating or modifying Slack UI components:
- **ALWAYS** write reusable block functions in `src/utils/blockHelper.js` - never inline blocks
- **ALWAYS** follow formatting guidelines from `docs/slack-markdown-guidelines.md`
- Use consistent emoji prefixes for message types (see blockHelper.js for conventions)
- Prefer rich_text_input for multi-line text fields in modals
- Use context blocks for supplementary information
- Test blocks in Slack to ensure proper rendering

### Documentation Requirements
When adding/updating features:
1. **README.md**: Document all user-facing commands and features
2. **Slack Manifest**: Update `scripts/updateSlackManifest.js` if adding new commands or permissions
3. **Web Docs**: Update documentation pages in `web/src/` if feature has web UI
4. **Agent Assistance**: Call readme-updater agent after feature additions
5. **Block Kit**: Ensure UI follows `docs/slack-markdown-guidelines.md`

### Testing Approach
No automated tests currently configured - manual testing via Slack interactions and script execution.
- Test slash commands in Slack workspace
- Verify scheduler jobs with `npm run debug:scheduler`
- Check team member eligibility with `npm run team:members`
- Test web frontend locally with `cd web && npm run dev`
