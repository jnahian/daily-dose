## üîÑ How It Works

### Daily Flow

1. **Morning Reminder**: Bot sends DM at your team's standup time
2. **Submission Window**: You have until the posting time to submit
3. **Team Summary**: Bot posts formatted summary to team channel
4. **Late Submissions**: Added as thread replies if submitted after posting time

### Standup Format

Each standup includes:

- **Last Working Day's Tasks**: What you worked on your last working day
- **Today's Tasks**: What you plan to work on today
- **Blockers**: Any obstacles or help needed

### Team Summary

The bot posts a formatted summary showing:

- All submitted standups with responses
- List of team members who haven't submitted
- Members on leave (automatically excluded)
- Members who opted out of non-responded list (can still submit but won't be listed as not responded)

## üë• Team Setup (Admin Guide)

### Creating a Team

1. Use `/dd-team-create [team-name] <standup-time> <posting-time>` in the channel where you want standups posted
   - **Channel-based**: `/dd-team-create 09:30 10:00` (uses channel name as team name)
   - **Custom name**: `/dd-team-create Engineering 09:30 10:00` (creates team with custom name)
2. Set appropriate times:
   - **Standup Time**: When reminders are sent (e.g., 09:30)
   - **Posting Time**: When summary is posted (e.g., 10:00)
3. Team members can join using:
   - **Channel-based**: `/dd-team-join` (joins team in current channel)
   - **Name-based**: `/dd-team-join Engineering` (joins specific team from any channel)

### Time Configuration

- Times are in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
- Each team can have its own timezone
- Default timezone is America/New_York

### Admin Notification Settings

Team admins can control whether they receive notifications when team members submit their standups:

```bash
# Disable standup submission notifications for admins
/dd-team-update Engineering notifications=false

# Re-enable notifications (default behavior)
/dd-team-update Engineering notifications=true
```

**Notification Behavior:**
- **Enabled (default)**: Team admins receive a DM notification each time a team member submits their standup
- **Disabled**: Admins will not receive these submission notifications, reducing notification volume for large teams
- This setting only affects admin notifications, not team member reminders or team summary posting

### Example Team Setup

```bash
# Create a team that sends reminders at 9:30 AM and posts summary at 10:00 AM
# Channel-based (uses channel name as team name)
/dd-team-create 09:30 10:00

# Or with custom team name
/dd-team-create Engineering 09:30 10:00

# Team members join (multiple ways)
/dd-team-join              # Join the team in current channel
/dd-team-join Engineering  # Join specific team by name from any channel

# Update team settings (multiple ways)
/dd-team-update notifications=false           # Update team in current channel
/dd-team-update Engineering notifications=false  # Update specific team by name
```

## üìù Standup Updates

You can update your standup for any day using the update command:

```bash
# Update today's standup for specific team
/dd-standup-update Engineering

# Update standup for specific date and team
/dd-standup-update Engineering 2024-12-20
```

### Update Behavior

- **Pre-filled Form**: If you already submitted a standup for that date, the form opens with your existing data
- **New Submission**: If no standup exists for that date, it opens a fresh form
- **Thread Updates**: When updating today's standup after the posting time, your update will automatically be posted to the team channel thread
- **Historical Updates**: You can update standups for past or future dates without thread posting

## üîï Standup Reminder Preferences

You can control your visibility in the "Not Responded" section of team standup summaries while still maintaining the ability to submit standups.

### Channel-Based Operation

When used without a team name, the command operates on the team associated with the current Slack channel:

```bash
# Check your current reminder preference for team in current channel
/dd-standup-reminder

# Opt out from appearing in "Not Responded" list for current channel team
/dd-standup-reminder off

# Opt back in to appear in "Not Responded" list for current channel team (default)
/dd-standup-reminder on
```

### Cross-Channel Operation

When a team name is provided, the command works from any channel:

```bash
# Check your current reminder preference for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering

# Opt out from appearing in "Not Responded" list for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering off

# Opt back in to appear in "Not Responded" list for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering on
```

### Smart Parameter Detection

The command intelligently detects whether your first argument is an action ("on"/"off") or a team name:

- If you type `on` or `off` as the first argument, it applies to the team in the current channel
- If you type anything else as the first argument, it's treated as a team name
- This allows for flexible usage patterns depending on your workflow

### How It Works

- **Opted In (Default)**: You appear in the "Not Responded" list if you don't submit a standup
- **Opted Out**: You won't appear in the "Not Responded" list, but you can still submit standups normally
- **Still Get Reminders**: You continue to receive DM reminders regardless of this setting
- **Per-Team Setting**: This preference is set individually for each team you're part of
- **Team Membership Required**: You must be a member of the team to modify your reminder preferences
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately for future standup summaries

### Use Cases

This feature is useful for:
- **Part-time team members** who don't submit daily but contribute occasionally
- **Consultants or contractors** with irregular schedules
- **Team leads or managers** who participate optionally in standups
- **Cross-functional members** who only contribute when relevant
- **Team members with varying availability** who want to reduce notification pressure
- **Members transitioning between teams** who need flexible participation levels

### Common Error Scenarios

```bash
# Error: No team in current channel
/dd-standup-reminder off
# Response: "‚ùå No team found in this channel. Please provide team name: /dd-standup-reminder TeamName [on|off]"

# Error: Team doesn't exist
/dd-standup-reminder NonexistentTeam off  
# Response: "‚ùå Team 'NonexistentTeam' not found"

# Error: Not a team member
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering off
# Response: "‚ùå You are not a member of team 'Engineering'"

# Error: Invalid action
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering maybe
# Response: "‚ùå Invalid action 'maybe'. Use 'on' to opt in or 'off' to opt out."
```

### Example Workflows

**Scenario 1: Working from team channel**
```bash
# You're in the #engineering channel where the Engineering team is configured
/dd-standup-reminder               # Check current status for Engineering team
/dd-standup-reminder off           # Opt out of non-responded list for Engineering team
/dd-standup-reminder on            # Opt back in for Engineering team
```

**Scenario 2: Working from different channel**
```bash
# You're in #general but want to manage Marketing team preferences
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing     # Check status for Marketing team
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing off # Opt out of Marketing team non-responded list
```

**Scenario 3: Managing multiple teams**
```bash
# Check and modify preferences for different teams
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering          # Check Engineering team status
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing off        # Opt out of Marketing team
/dd-standup-reminder DevOps on            # Ensure opted in for DevOps team
```

## üéâ Holiday Management ‚ö†Ô∏è (Admin Only)
