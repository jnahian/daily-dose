## How It Works

### Daily Flow

1. **Morning Reminder**: Bot sends DM at your team's standup time
2. **Submission Window**: You have until the posting time to submit
3. **Team Summary**: Bot posts formatted summary to team channel
4. **Late Submissions**: Added as thread replies if submitted after posting time

### Standup Format

Each standup includes:

- **Yesterday's Tasks**: What you worked on yesterday
- **Today's Tasks**: What you plan to work on today
- **Blockers**: Any obstacles or help needed

### Team Summary

The bot posts a formatted summary showing:

- All submitted standups with responses
- List of team members who haven't submitted
- Members on leave (automatically excluded)

## Team Setup (Admin Guide)

### Creating a Team

1. Use `/dd-team-create <name> <standup-time> <posting-time>` in the channel where you want standups posted
2. Set appropriate times:
   - **Standup Time**: When reminders are sent (e.g., 09:30)
   - **Posting Time**: When summary is posted (e.g., 10:00)
3. Team members can join using `/dd-team-join <team-name>`

### Time Configuration

- Times are in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
- Each team can have its own timezone
- Default timezone is America/New_York

### Example Team Setup

```bash
# Create a team that sends reminders at 9:30 AM and posts summary at 10:00 AM
/dd-team-create Engineering 09:30 10:00

# Team members join
/dd-team-join Engineering
```

## Standup Updates

You can update your standup for any day using the update command:

```bash
# Update today's standup for specific team
/dd-standup-update Engineering

# Update standup for specific date and team
/dd-standup-update Engineering 2024-12-20
```

### Update Behavior

- **Pre-filled Form**: If you already submitted a standup for that date, the form opens with your existing data
- **New Submission**: If no standup exists for that date, it opens a fresh form
- **Thread Updates**: When updating today's standup after the posting time, your update will automatically be posted to the team channel thread
- **Historical Updates**: You can update standups for past or future dates without thread posting

## Holiday Management ⚠️ (Admin Only)

Admins can manage organization-wide holidays that affect standup schedules:

### Setting Holidays ⚠️ (Admin Only)

```bash
# Single day holiday
/dd-holiday-set 2024-12-25 Christmas Day

# Multi-day holiday range
/dd-holiday-set 2024-12-24 2024-12-26 Christmas Holiday

# Holiday without custom name (will use default)
/dd-holiday-set 2024-07-04
```

### Managing Holidays ⚠️ (Admin Only)

```bash
# Update holiday name
/dd-holiday-update 2024-12-25 Christmas Day Updated

# Delete single day holiday
/dd-holiday-delete 2024-12-25

# Delete holiday range
/dd-holiday-delete 2024-12-24 2024-12-26
```

### Holiday Effects

When holidays are set:
- No standup reminders are sent on holiday dates
- Team members are automatically excluded from standup expectations
- Holiday status is reflected in team summaries

## Leave Management

### Setting Leave

```bash
# Single day
/dd-leave-set 2024-12-25 Christmas Day

# Multiple days
/dd-leave-set 2024-12-23 2024-12-27 Holiday break
```

### Managing Leaves

```bash
# View upcoming leaves
/dd-leave-list

# Cancel a leave (use ID from list)
/dd-leave-cancel abc12345
```

When you're on leave:

- No standup reminders are sent
- You're marked as "On leave" in team summaries
- Automatic exclusion from standup expectations

## Work Days Configuration

### Default Work Days

- Organization default is typically Monday-Friday (1,2,3,4,5)
- You can set personal work days that override the default

### Setting Personal Work Days

```bash
# Standard Monday-Friday
/dd-workdays-set 1,2,3,4,5

# Monday-Thursday + Sunday (4-day week with Sunday)
/dd-workdays-set 1,2,3,4,7

# Tuesday-Saturday
/dd-workdays-set 2,3,4,5,6
```

### Viewing Work Days
