## üîÑ How It Works

### Daily Flow

1. **Morning Reminder**: Bot sends DM at your team's standup time
2. **Submission Window**: You have until the posting time to submit
3. **Team Summary**: Bot posts formatted summary to team channel
4. **Late Submissions**: Added as thread replies if submitted after posting time

### Standup Format

Each standup includes:

- **Last Working Day's Tasks**: What you worked on your last working day
- **Today's Tasks**: What you plan to work on today
- **Blockers**: Any obstacles or help needed

### Team Summary

The bot posts a formatted summary showing:

- All submitted standups with responses
- List of team members who haven't submitted
- Members on leave (automatically excluded)
- Members who opted out of non-responded list (can still submit but won't be listed as not responded)

## üë• Team Setup (Admin Guide)

### Creating a Team

1. Use `/dd-team-create [team-name] <standup-time> <posting-time>` in the channel where you want standups posted
   - **Channel-based**: `/dd-team-create 09:30 10:00` (uses channel name as team name)
   - **Custom name**: `/dd-team-create Engineering 09:30 10:00` (creates team with custom name)
2. Set appropriate times:
   - **Standup Time**: When reminders are sent (e.g., 09:30)
   - **Posting Time**: When summary is posted (e.g., 10:00)
3. Team members can join using:
   - **Channel-based**: `/dd-team-join` (joins team in current channel)
   - **Name-based**: `/dd-team-join Engineering` (joins specific team from any channel)

### Time Configuration

- Times are in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
- Each team can have its own timezone
- Default timezone is America/New_York

### Admin Notification Settings

Team admins can control whether they receive notifications when team members submit their standups:

```bash
# Disable standup submission notifications for admins
/dd-team-update Engineering notifications=false

# Re-enable notifications (default behavior)
/dd-team-update Engineering notifications=true
```

**Notification Behavior:**
- **Enabled (default)**: Team admins receive a DM notification each time a team member submits their standup
- **Disabled**: Admins will not receive these submission notifications, reducing notification volume for large teams
- This setting only affects admin notifications, not team member reminders or team summary posting

### Example Team Setup

```bash
# Create a team that sends reminders at 9:30 AM and posts summary at 10:00 AM
# Channel-based (uses channel name as team name)
/dd-team-create 09:30 10:00

# Or with custom team name
/dd-team-create Engineering 09:30 10:00

# Team members join (multiple ways)
/dd-team-join              # Join the team in current channel
/dd-team-join Engineering  # Join specific team by name from any channel

# Update team settings (multiple ways)
/dd-team-update notifications=false           # Update team in current channel
/dd-team-update Engineering notifications=false  # Update specific team by name
```

## üìù Standup Updates

You can update your standup for any day using the update command:

```bash
# Update today's standup for team in current channel
/dd-standup-update

# Update today's standup for specific team
/dd-standup-update Engineering

# Update standup for specific date (team in current channel)
/dd-standup-update 2024-12-20

# Update standup for specific date and team
/dd-standup-update Engineering 2024-12-20
```

### Update Behavior

- **Pre-filled Form**: If you already submitted a standup for that date, the form opens with your existing data
- **New Submission**: If no standup exists for that date, it opens a fresh form
- **Thread Updates**: When updating today's standup after the posting time, your update will automatically be posted to the team channel thread
- **Historical Updates**: You can update standups for past or future dates without thread posting

## üîï Standup Reminder Preferences

You can control both your visibility in the "Not Responded" section of team standup summaries and whether you receive reminder notifications.

### Channel-Based Operation

When used without a team name, the command operates on the team associated with the current Slack channel:

```bash
# Check your current preferences for team in current channel
/dd-standup-reminder

# Opt out from appearing in "Not Responded" list for current channel team
/dd-standup-reminder mention=off

# Disable reminder notifications for current channel team
/dd-standup-reminder notify=off

# Configure both preferences for current channel team
/dd-standup-reminder mention=on notify=on
```

### Cross-Channel Operation

When a team name is provided, the command works from any channel:

```bash
# Check your current preferences for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering

# Opt out from appearing in "Not Responded" list for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering mention=off

# Disable reminder notifications for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering notify=off

# Configure both preferences for specific team
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering mention=on notify=on
```

### Parameter Requirements

The command requires at least one of the following parameters:

- **mention=on/off**: Controls whether you appear in the "Not Responded" list when you haven't submitted
- **notify=on/off**: Controls whether you receive DM reminder notifications
- You can use one or both parameters in a single command
- Parameters can be combined: `/dd-standup-reminder mention=off notify=on`

### How It Works

- **Mention Setting**:
  - **mention=on (Default)**: You appear in the "Not Responded" list if you don't submit a standup
  - **mention=off**: You won't appear in the "Not Responded" list, but can still submit standups normally
- **Notify Setting**:
  - **notify=on (Default)**: You receive DM reminders at the team's standup time
  - **notify=off**: You won't receive DM reminders, but can still submit standups manually
- **Independent Controls**: Both settings work independently - you can disable mentions but keep notifications, or vice versa
- **Per-Team Setting**: These preferences are set individually for each team you're part of
- **Team Membership Required**: You must be a member of the team to modify your preferences
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately for future standup summaries and reminders

### Use Cases

This feature is useful for:
- **Part-time team members** who don't submit daily but contribute occasionally
- **Consultants or contractors** with irregular schedules
- **Team leads or managers** who participate optionally in standups
- **Cross-functional members** who only contribute when relevant
- **Team members with varying availability** who want to reduce notification pressure
- **Members transitioning between teams** who need flexible participation levels

### Common Error Scenarios

```bash
# Error: No team in current channel
/dd-standup-reminder mention=off
# Response: "‚ùå No team found in this channel. Please provide team name: /dd-standup-reminder TeamName mention=on/off notify=on/off"

# Error: Team doesn't exist
/dd-standup-reminder NonexistentTeam mention=off
# Response: "‚ùå Team 'NonexistentTeam' not found"

# Error: Not a team member

# Error: No parameters provided
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering
# Response: "‚ÑπÔ∏è Current preferences for Engineering team: mention=on, notify=on" (shows current status)

# Error: Invalid parameter format
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering maybe=off
# Response: "‚ùå Invalid parameter 'maybe=off'. Use mention=on/off or notify=on/off"

# Error: Missing parameters when updating
/dd-standup-reminder
# Response: "‚ÑπÔ∏è Current preferences for [TeamName]: mention=on, notify=on" (shows current status)
```

### Example Workflows

**Scenario 1: Working from team channel**
```bash
# You're in the #engineering channel where the Engineering team is configured
/dd-standup-reminder                        # Check current preferences for Engineering team
/dd-standup-reminder mention=off            # Opt out of "not responded" list for Engineering team
/dd-standup-reminder notify=off             # Disable reminder notifications for Engineering team
/dd-standup-reminder mention=on notify=on   # Re-enable both preferences for Engineering team
```

**Scenario 2: Working from different channel**
```bash
# You're in #general but want to manage Marketing team preferences
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing              # Check preferences for Marketing team
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing mention=off  # Opt out of Marketing team "not responded" list
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing notify=off   # Disable Marketing team reminders
```

**Scenario 3: Managing multiple teams with different needs**
```bash
# Check and modify preferences for different teams
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering                    # Check Engineering team preferences
/dd-standup-reminder Marketing mention=off          # Opt out of Marketing mentions but keep notifications
/dd-standup-reminder DevOps notify=off              # Disable DevOps reminders but stay in mention list
/dd-standup-reminder QA mention=off notify=off      # Completely opt out of QA team reminders and mentions
```

**Scenario 4: Part-time team member setup**
```bash
# Configure for part-time participation - no reminders but can submit when needed
/dd-standup-reminder Engineering mention=off notify=off  # Remove from mentions and disable reminders
# You can still manually submit with /dd-standup Engineering when participating
```

## üéâ Holiday Management ‚ö†Ô∏è (Admin Only)

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### For Team Members

- **Be Consistent**: Submit standups regularly to help team coordination
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable updates
- **Mention Blockers**: Don't hesitate to ask for help
- **Set Leave Early**: Update your leave dates in advance
